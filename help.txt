Authors: Alexandre Santos (2181593) & AndrÃ© Azevedo (2182634)

    Description:

In informatics, a shell is an application that receives and interprets commands, like the BASH, ZSH or CSH.
In this project, we created the **nanoShell** shell application that should be able to:
    1) Execute an application with multiple input parameters
    2) Capture signal sent for the nanoShell
    3) Support standard output redirects (**>** and **>>**) and standard errors (**2>** e **2>>**)
    4) Show a help summary

    Options:

    -f          file            - run a list of commands in a file (filename argument). Each line should be a command
    -h          help            - shows a brief summary of options and arguments of each available option
    -m          max             - define the maximum number of commands the nanoShell should execute before terminating
    -s          signal file     - creates a "signal.txt" file with all available commands that can send signals to the nanoShell.

    Arguments:

    -f, --file <fich>
    -h, --help
    -m, --max <int>
    -s, --signalfile

    Exit Status:
    
    Returns success unless PATTERN is not found or an invalid option is given.
